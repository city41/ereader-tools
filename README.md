## Publishing

ereader-tools uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)

Publishing a new version is done by bumping the version in package.json

```bash
yarn version
yarn version v1.22.19
info Current version: 0.4.0
question New version: 0.4.1
info New version: 0.4.1
Done in 16.19s.

git push
git push --tags
```

Once [the Publish action](https://github.com/city41/ereader-tools/actions/workflows/publish.yml) notices the version has changed, it will run a build and publish to npm.
